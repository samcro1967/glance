This integration retrieves monitoring information from Gotify and converts it to the shared [Custom API Monitoring](../../README.md) JSON contract.

The example keeps data collection separate from Glance. `fetch.py` produces a JSON file, and Glance consumes that file through a URL served by your environment.

![Gotify monitoring example](../../../../../images/examples/custom-api/monitoring/gotify.png)

## Files

- [fetch.py](fetch.py) retrieves and normalizes the monitoring data.
- [example.json](example.json) provides deterministic representative output and is also used by Glance's visual test fixture.
- [template.yml](../../template.yml) provides the shared Custom API monitoring presentation.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- The `requests` Python package
- A Gotify API accessible from the system running the producer

## Configuration

The producer is configured with environment variables:

- `GOTIFY_URL` — Gotify base URL. Defaults to `http://localhost:80`.
- `GOTIFY_TOKEN` — Gotify application token.
- `OUTPUT_FILE` — generated JSON path. Defaults to `monitoring.json`.

## Usage

Run the producer after supplying the configuration required by your environment:

```bash
python3 fetch.py
```

By default the example writes `monitoring.json` in the current directory. Set `OUTPUT_FILE` when another destination is required.

Serve the generated JSON over HTTP from a location reachable by Glance. Keep credentials outside the script and outside files committed to source control.

## Reported data

The producer reports the number of Gotify applications and messages together with the server health and version.

A successful collection produces an overall `ok` state. API or connectivity failures prevent a new monitoring document from being successfully produced rather than presenting failed collection as healthy application data.

The expandable section lists applications with their available message counts when there is application activity to report.

## Glance configuration

```yaml
- type: custom-api
  title: Gotify
  url: https://example.com/gotify_metrics.json
  cache: 5m
  headers:
    Accept: application/json
  template: |
    $include: path/to/monitoring/template.yml
```

Adjust the URL and template path for your environment.

## Scheduling

`fetch.py` is an external producer and is not executed by Glance. Run it periodically using cron, a systemd timer, a container scheduler, or another scheduler appropriate for your environment.

The producer schedule and the Custom API `cache` interval are independent. The example intentionally leaves alert delivery and environment-specific operational automation outside the producer.
